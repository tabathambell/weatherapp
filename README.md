# Weather App

## Description
This assignment was a little more complicated. The biggest issue I had was figuring out the right API to use from Open Weather to know exactly which tags I needed to use in order to get the correct output on the page. The Bootstrap part of the assignment was very simple and easy and it made the page look nice and simple. 

The way it works is the top search bar will produce any city that is placed in it. When something is searched, it will pop on the left side panel and it will be clickable to return to that particular city for reference. It will show up the five day forecast and the current weather in all of the boxes provided. 

Using JQuery, this assignment was built by using the reference tags in the API's listing in order to get humidity, temperature, UV index, etc. While it was providing this information in Kelvin, I modified it to show Fahrenheit using simple math. The history local storage was provided using a for loop as well as append child. Wind was also converted from meters per second to miles per hour. 

I also ended up using Moment.js in order to provide a header that shows what day those temperatures were assigned to, which made it a little bit more interesting and easy to read.
